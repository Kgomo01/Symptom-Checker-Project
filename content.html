            <h2>What is Our Symptom Checker?</h2>
            <p>Our symptom checker is an online tool designed to help individuals assess their health based on the symptoms they are experiencing. 
               By simply selecting symptoms from a list, users can receive preliminary information that may indicate potential health concerns. 
               This service aims to provide guidance and support for those unsure about their health conditions.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The symptom checker operates by utilizing a comprehensive database of common symptoms and related conditions. When users input their
              symptoms, the tool analyzes the information and generates possible conditions that match the symptoms provided. While this tool can help
              identify potential issues, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment.</p>

            <p>Our goal is to empower users with knowledge about their health, making it easier to understand when to seek medical assistance. 
              We prioritize user privacy and ensure that all interactions are secure and confidential. Remember, your health is important, and our
              symptom checker is here to assist you on your journey to better well-being.</p>
